def pad_sequence(sequences, batch_first=False, padding_value=0):
    r"""Pad a list of variable length Variables with zero

    ``pad_sequence`` stacks a list of Variables along a new dimension,
    and padds them to equal length. For example, if the input is list of
    sequences with size ``L x *`` and if batch_first is False, and ``T x B x *``
    otherwise. The list of sequences should be sorted in the order of
    decreasing length.

    `B` is batch size. It's equal to the number of elements in ``sequences``.
    `T` is length of the longest sequence.
    `L` is length of the sequence.
    `*` is any number of trailing dimensions, including none.

    Example:
        >>> from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pad_sequence
        >>> a = Variable(torch.ones(25, 300))
        >>> b = Variable(torch.ones(22, 300))
        >>> c = Variable(torch.ones(15, 300))
        >>> pad_sequence([a, b, c]).size()
        torch.Size([25, 3, 300])

    Note:
        This function returns a Variable of size ``T x B x *`` or ``B x T x *`` where `T` is the
            length of longest sequence.
        Function assumes trailing dimensions and type of all the Variables
            in sequences are same.

    Arguments:
        sequences (list[Variable]): list of variable length sequences.
        batch_first (bool, optional): output will be in ``B x T x *`` if True, or in
            ``T x B x *`` otherwise
        padding_value (float, optional): value for padded elements.

    Returns:
        Variable of size ``T x B x *`` if batch_first is False
        Variable of size ``B x T x *`` otherwise
